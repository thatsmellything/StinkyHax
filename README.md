A huge repo on tools and guides on how to use those tools. All homemade so problems may arise on your machines that didn't happen to me. Hope this helps all of you become better pen testers :)

PLEASE REALIZE THAT I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THESE TOOLS AND THAT ALL THE CREDIT FOR THEIR UTILITY AND USEFULLNESS SHOULD GO TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CREATORS! I ALOS TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW MY NOTES ARE USED. I am not responcible for damages of any kind. Please be smart about this. Do not use these tools on systems that you don't have permission to do so on. These notes are for educational purposes only!
