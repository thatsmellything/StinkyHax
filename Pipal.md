how to use pipal

pipal basically as far as I understand it is able

to take a word list aka a dictionary for stuff

like passwords and then tell you what is most used

and what the passwords share in common.

you use it like this

sudo pipal (file 2 scan) -o (output file).txt

and thats basically it, Im sure there are other

uses for it but thats all I understand so far
